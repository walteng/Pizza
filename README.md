## Description

It is an app for my pizza place and as a strategy to widen my customer base I decide to create a web application where my customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings and crust.



## Setup/Installation Requirements

-   First, run the index.html path as the source code.
-   Secondly,no web server is necessary to run the app
-   Thirdly,the dependencies include the html, css, images,and jQuery files.

The set is easy and requires less technical know-how to run
## BDD
# UI logic
- Choose the size of pizza I want e.g Small, Medium, Large
- Choose what kind of crust I would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free
- Choose the topping(s) I want on my pizza.
- Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
- Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
- Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
- If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
# BI logic
- Determine the prices for each pizza size.
- Each pizza topping should have a set value depending on the size of the pizza.
- Determine the cost for the crust
- The total cost of a pizza should constitute, the crust, topping(s) and size of the pizza.
- On checkout, the application displays the ordersâ€™ summary together with the total amount charged. For example, if the customer has made more than one pizza order, on checkout the application displays a summary of all the orders he/she has made and the total amount to pay for all his/her orders.
## Known Bugs

Most of the bugs have been resolved except for the Javascript code that is incomplete.

## Technologies Used

The app is only built by use of HTML, CSS(bootstrap and css), and javascript (jQuery).
